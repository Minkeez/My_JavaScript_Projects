# My JavaScript Projects (0 to Hero)
Welcome to my **"0 to Hero"** JavaScript portfolio! This repository contains a series of projects that showcase my learning journey in JavaScript—from basic concepts to advanced applications. Each project is stored in its own folder with relevant documentation and code.

### Overview
This repository is a collection of **100+ JavaScript projects** (and growing!), each focusing on different aspects of JavaScript development. My goal is to:
- **Master JavaScript by Practicing** — Build projects from beginner to expert level.
- **Explore Various Domains** — From console-based scripts to full-stack web applications, APIs, real-time apps, and more.
- **Build a Strong Portfolio** — Showcase each project, demonstrating progression and depth in JavaScript development.

### Repository Structure
Each project is stored in a separate folder, following a structured format:
```
My_JavaScript_Projects/
├── 01_Hello_World_CLI/
│   ├── app.js
│   ├── README.md
│   └── ...
├── 02_Simple_Calculator/
│   ├── ...
│   └── ...
├── 03_ToDo_List/
├── 04_...
├── .gitignore
├── README.md  <-- (this file)
└── ...
```
Within each project folder:
- `app.js` (or a similarly named script) contains the main JavaScript code.
- `README.md` provides details about that project (usage, requirements, etc.).
- Additional files (e.g., `package.json`, `config.js`, dependencies, or frontend files) may be included when necessary.

### Project List
1. **01_Hello_World_CLI**
   _A simple command-line tool that prints "Hello, World!" or greets the user by name._
2. ...
   _And so on, until we reach 100+ projects!_

As I complete each project, I will update this list with a title, summary, and link to the subfolder.
